Well, it used to be, but now you can find it at my [blog](https://manoel.tech/01-my-desktop-setup).

## Thanks
I'd like to really thank the developers who took some of their time to help the community and provide so many nice tools/themes/tips. Really appreciate it!

## Goodbye!
Hope you can find some usefulness in this setup! If you want to give a hello, shout out, my Twitter is [@ManoelTLobo](https://www.twitter.com/ManoelTLobo). See you!
